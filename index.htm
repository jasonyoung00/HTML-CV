<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>I am a diligent, inquisitive computer scientist undergraduate adept in coding specifically, with a strong foundation in C# and Python. Seeking to develop solid skills in collaboration, communication, and development as a programmer for a software or video game development company.</p>
<p>In the future, I wish to work as a programmer at a computing company in the industry. More specifically, I wish to be a programmer for companies that develop video games or program software. As a programmer I expect to have many responsibilities. Some responsibilities I expect are being part of a group and working with them to complete a task. I will need to be organised, have high standards about the outcome and be synchronised with my other group members to complete the task on time.</p>
